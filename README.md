# STARSET – INFECTED

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
I think we did it this time
There's something in the air
inside the star shine
There's something in the air
we'll never know
I can feel it take hold
Infected
They're calling on the landlines
The senators are standing
on the shorelines
The warning lights are burning
all aglow
Now we reap what we sow
Infected
We do it one by one
Put your hands up and run
We're addicted to the panic
And we hate the way this world
has become
But there ain't no cure for it
We've been infected, infected
Infected, infected
Infected, infected
Infected, infected
Here's a challenge
for all mankind
The preacher man is warning of
the end times
The weatherman agrees
but he don't know
So he's got to go now
We do it one by one
Put your hands up and run
We're addicted to the panic
And we hate the way
this world has become
But there ain't no cure for it
We've been infected, infected
Infected, infected
Infected, infected
Infected, infected
One if by land and two if by sea
Maybe it's both
and we'll all get lucky
Go to the end,
man I Don't quit on me
Get what you wanted
Anarchy
One by one
Put your hands up and run
We're addicted to the panic
And we hate the way
this world has become
But there ain't no cure for it
We've been infected, infected
Infected, infected
Infected, infected
Infected, infected
